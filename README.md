# Console Application

This is a simple .NET Console Application that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

The main idea of this project is to start from a very simple project, and continuously add complexity, following best coding practices, SOLID, design patterns and whatever is needed to make the project as complex and professional as possible.

## Upgrades for this useless application
- ~~Basic Console Application~~
- ~~Add Dockerfile~~
- Upgraded Console Application (Business Logic extracted)
- Add WebAPI Project and connect it to the existing business logic
